# Project Euler Problem 14
## [Longest Collatz Sequence](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14)

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

n → n/2 (n is even)
n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

## Adding and Contributing Solutions

### First Clone the Repository

The easiest way to download the needed files is to clone the entire repository from your personal account. You will need to install [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) for this. 

```
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/ProjectEuler-####.git
cd ProjectEuler-####
```

### Adding New Solution

To add a new solution, just create new folder in `ProjectEuler-####` and place your files there. If your solution is a mathematical right up, you can right it in a `README.md` file or post a write-up in LaTeX. If you choose LaTeX, make sure and post the source files, and not just the PDF. 

Now that you have added your solution locally, you need to push it to the main repository. 

```
git add ./*
git commit -a -m 'message explaining what you added'
git push origin master
```


### Contribute to Existing Solutions

While anyone has the ability to modify existing files, it is best if you use GitHub's `issues` to discuss the changes with the original author before making any modifications. To modify the files, you only need to clone the repository, make changes, and then push your commits as above.
